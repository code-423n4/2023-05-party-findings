### Low Risk Findings

#### [L-01] Host can reenter rageQuit

##### Description

During rageQuit, rageQuitTimestamp is deleted setting it to zero. This is supposed to prevent reentrancy into the rageQuit function. However if the host is the caller they can reenter by first using setRageQuit to an appropriate timestamp allowing them to bypass the check in L302. I do not see any way the host can abuse this to their advantage which I why I am reporting this as low.

##### Mitigation

Consider setting rageQuitTimestamp to some other constant value such as RAGEQUIT_ENTERED instead of deleting it. Additionally check for this value in both setRageQuit and rageQuit.

#### [L-02] Host can reduce rageQuit window

##### Description

setRageQuit never checks that the new timestamp is after the current end of the ragequit window. This allows hosts to bait and swap users. Users may think they can ragequit (and are therefore protected) up until a certain time but the host can change this at any time and trap unsuspecting users.

##### Mitigation

Don't allow the new timestamp to be before the old timestamp

#### [L-03] setRageQuit and rageQuit lack onlyDelegateCall modifiers

##### Description

setRageQuit and rageQuit lack onlyDelegateCall modifiers allowing them to be called on the implementation

##### Mitigation

Add onlyDelegateCall modifier to setRageQuit and rageQuit
